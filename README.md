# catalog
Repository for a default catalog implementation.

A variation of install procedures are supported:

- Installation on [Docker](docker)
- Installation on a [Local](local) machine

For server-site installation, docker is recommended, but you can also use the local machine procedure. In the latter case, you might need to create some startup and shutdown scripts.
